## Integrity

The script runs entirely on your computer and does not upload any files to the internet. The only network activity it does is download one utility library.

## Features

1. Recursively loads images from selected directory.
2. Can horizontally and vertically split slides using "settings" at the top right.
3. Splits videos that are longer than 1 minute into 1 minute slides (does not change your local files).
4. Volume slider for controlling all videos.

There are probably bugs.
